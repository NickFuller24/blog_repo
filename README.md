# blog_repo
This repo will be used to house my blog files. I will be using GatsbyJS, GraphQL, and markdown files to create the blog and I hope to deploy using Netlify.

To start, I used the gatsby default starter. This starter can be found at https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/

To get started with Gatsby, Markdown files, and GraphQL, I will be following a few youtube videos put out by Level Up Tutorials. Those videos can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1NaVkKdrwc

I am also referring to the GatsbyJS Docs. Those can be found here: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/adding-markdown-pages/#transform-markdown-to-html-and-frontmatter-to-data-using-gatsby-transformer-remark
